# Aura ðŸŽ§

A simple focus dashboard I built to help me get work done. It combines a timer, to-do list, and focus sounds all in one place.

## Why I Built This

I was tired of juggling a bunch of different tabs just to stay focused. This app is my solution: a single, calm space for deep work.

## Features

- A simple to-do list with priority tags
- A Pomodoro-style timer
- An ambient sound player
- A clean clock and greeting panel
- All panels can be minimized to keep things tidy

## How to Run It

1.  Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/devo-id/aura.git`
2.  `cd aura`
3.  `npm install`
4.  `npm run dev`
